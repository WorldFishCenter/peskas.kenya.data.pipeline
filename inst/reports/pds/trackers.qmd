## Executive Summary {.highlight-box}

This study presents comprehensive vessel monitoring analysis from Kenya's small-scale fisheries using 150 solar-powered Pelagic Data Systems (PDS) deployed across 28 Beach Management Units in five coastal counties. Analysis of **46,625 high-resolution tracking records** reveals critical patterns: **fishing hotspots** concentrated in near-shore areas (1-3km), **seasonal trends** in effort distribution, **resource conflict zones** with high vessel overlap, and **vessel activity coefficients** showing fleet utilization patterns. These findings provide essential evidence for marine spatial planning, adaptive management, and inclusive governance within Kenya's Blue Economy framework.

## Fleet Overview & Vessel Activity Coefficient

The analysis of Kenya's small-scale fishing fleet reveals a highly active and diverse fishing sector. The deployment of 150 solar-powered tracking devices across five coastal counties has generated an unprecedented dataset of vessel movements, providing unique insights into the operational characteristics of this critical fishery.

Understanding vessel activity patterns is essential for effective fisheries management. The Vessel Activity Coefficient (VAC) developed here quantifies fishing intensity by measuring the average number of trips per week for each vessel. This metric helps identify highly active vessels, seasonal variations in fleet behavior, and regional differences in fishing effort.

      TRUE ~ "Very High (>3 trips/week)"
    )
  )

# VAC distribution visualization

  hc_yAxis(title = list(text = "Trips per Week")) %>%
  hc_tooltip(
    pointFormat = "<b>Vessel {point.x}</b><br>VAC: {point.y} trips/week"
  )
```

The chart above shows the distribution of vessel activity across the fleet. **High-activity vessels** (\>3 trips/week) represent the most intensive fishing operations, while vessels with lower VAC scores may represent part-time fishers, seasonal operators, or vessels used for multiple purposes beyond fishing.

This activity distribution has important implications for resource management, as a small number of highly active vessels may account for a disproportionate share of total fishing effort and potential environmental impact.

## Spatial Analysis: Fishing Hotspots & Intensity

Understanding where fishing activity concentrates is crucial for marine spatial planning and resource management. This analysis identifies fishing hotspots using a grid-based approach that combines fishing effort (time spent) with vessel diversity (number of different boats) to create an intensity score.

**Fishing hotspots** are areas where multiple vessels consistently spend significant time fishing, suggesting either high resource abundance or favorable fishing conditions. These areas are critical for both conservation and management, as they represent locations where fishing pressure is most concentrated.

```{r fishing-hotspots}
# Calculate fishing hotspots using grid-based analysis
fishing_hotspots <- tracks_processed %>%
  filter(activity == "Fishing") %>%
  group_by(lat_grid, lng_grid) %>%
  summarise(
    fishing_hours = n() * 5 / 60, # Each record is 5 minutes
    unique_vessels = n_distinct(boat),
    unique_trips = n_distinct(trip),
    avg_speed = mean(speed_knots, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    # Calculate fishing intensity score
    intensity_score = fishing_hours * sqrt(unique_vessels),
    hotspot_category = case_when(
      intensity_score > quantile(intensity_score, 0.95) ~ "Critical Hotspot",
      intensity_score > quantile(intensity_score, 0.85) ~ "Major Hotspot",
      intensity_score > quantile(intensity_score, 0.70) ~ "Moderate Hotspot",
      TRUE ~ "Regular Activity"

The interactive map above reveals several critical patterns in Kenya's small-scale fisheries. **Red circles** highlight the most intensive fishing areas, where multiple vessels concentrate their efforts. The **color gradient** shows fishing intensity, with darker areas indicating higher effort.

**Key observations from the hotspot analysis:**

-   Hotspots are predominantly located in **near-shore waters** (1-3 km from coast), reflecting the limitations of small-scale vessels
-   **Clustered patterns** suggest areas of high resource abundance or favorable conditions
-   **Regional variations** in hotspot distribution indicate different fishing strategies and resource availability
-   **Critical hotspots** (top 5%) account for a disproportionate share of total fishing effort, making them priority areas for management attention

## Resource Conflict Analysis & Vessel Interactions

Small-scale fisheries often experience resource conflicts when multiple vessels compete for access to the same fishing areas. Understanding these interaction patterns is crucial for conflict resolution and sustainable management.

This analysis identifies **potential conflict zones** by detecting areas where multiple vessels operate simultaneously. While co-location doesn't always indicate conflict (vessels may be cooperating or following schools of fish), areas with persistent multi-vessel presence warrant attention from managers.

**Conflict risk levels** are determined by the average number of vessels present and the frequency of multi-vessel events. High-risk zones may benefit from access agreements, temporal restrictions, or enhanced communication systems among fishers.

```{r conflict-zones}
# Identify resource conflict zones based on simultaneous vessel presence

    n_vessels = n_distinct(boat),

```

The conflict zone map uses a **dark background** to highlight areas of vessel overlap, with **circle size** representing the total vessel-hours of potential conflict. **Colors** indicate risk levels: green for low risk, orange for moderate, and red for high-risk zones.

The temporal conflict chart shows **daily patterns** in multi-vessel events, revealing periods of higher competition intensity. **Peaks** may correspond to favorable fishing conditions, seasonal migrations, or market demands that draw multiple vessels to the same areas.

**Management implications:** - **High-risk zones** require priority attention for conflict prevention - **Temporal patterns** can inform timing of interventions or restrictions - **Communication systems** between vessels could reduce conflicts in shared areas - **Access agreements** among user groups may help manage competition

## Seasonal Trends & Temporal Patterns

Seasonal patterns in fishing activity reflect the complex interplay between environmental conditions, fish migration patterns, weather, and socio-economic factors. Understanding these temporal dynamics is essential for adaptive management and predicting fishing pressure throughout the year.

The analysis examines **monthly variations** in fishing effort, fleet activity, and spatial distribution. **Seasonal peaks** may indicate periods of high resource abundance, favorable weather conditions, or increased market demand, while **low-activity periods** might reflect rough weather, fish scarcity, or alternative livelihood activities.

**Daily departure patterns** reveal operational strategies, with most small-scale fishers preferring early morning departures to maximize fishing time and return before afternoon weather deteriorates.

```{r seasonal-analysis}
# Monthly fishing effort analysis
monthly_effort <- tracks_processed %>%
  filter(activity == "Fishing") %>%
  group_by(month, month_num) %>%
  summarise(
    fishing_hours = n() * 5 / 60,
    unique_vessels = n_distinct(boat),
    unique_trips = n_distinct(trip),
    avg_range = mean(range_km, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  arrange(month_num)

# Create seasonal trend visualization
highchart() %>%
  hc_add_series(
    data = monthly_effort,
    type = "column",
    hcaes(x = month, y = fishing_hours),
    name = "Fishing Hours",
    color = "#2E86AB"
  ) %>%
  hc_add_series(
    data = monthly_effort,
    type = "line",
    hcaes(x = month, y = unique_vessels),
    name = "Active Vessels",
    yAxis = 1, # uses the right-hand axis
    color = "#A23B72"
  ) |>
  hc_title(text = "Seasonal Fishing Patterns") %>%
  hc_subtitle(
    text = "Monthly variation in fishing effort and fleet activity"
  ) %>%
  hc_xAxis(categories = monthly_effort$month, title = list(text = "Month")) %>%
  hc_yAxis_multiples(
    list(title = list(text = "Fishing Hours")),
    list(title = list(text = "Active Vessels"), opposite = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  hc_tooltip(shared = TRUE)

# Daily activity patterns
hourly_patterns <- trip_summary %>%
  group_by(departure_hour) %>%
  summarise(
    n_trips = n(),
    avg_duration = mean(duration_hours),
    avg_range = mean(max_range_km),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

apex(
  data = hourly_patterns,
  type = "area",
  mapping = aes(x = departure_hour, y = n_trips)
) %>%
  ax_title(text = "Daily Departure Patterns") %>%
  ax_subtitle(
    text = "Trip initiation times showing early morning preference"
  ) %>%
  ax_colors("#3A86C7") %>%
  ax_fill(type = "gradient") %>%
  ax_xaxis(
    title = list(text = "Hour of Day"),
    min = 0,
    max = 23
  ) %>%
  ax_yaxis(title = list(text = "Number of Trips"))
```

The seasonal pattern chart reveals a **dual-axis visualization** showing both fishing effort (blue bars) and active vessels (red line). **Synchronized patterns** between effort and fleet size suggest consistent seasonal behavior, while **divergent trends** may indicate changes in individual vessel activity levels.

The departure time analysis shows a **clear preference** for early morning starts (5-8 AM), reflecting traditional fishing practices and the need to avoid afternoon weather deterioration. This pattern has important implications for **port infrastructure** planning and **market timing**.

## Trip Characteristics & Gear Usage Patterns

Understanding trip characteristics provides insights into fishing strategies, gear usage, and operational efficiency. Different gear types produce distinct trip signatures in terms of duration, distance traveled, and time spent fishing versus transit.

**Trip duration categories** help identify different fishing strategies: short trips often indicate trap or net fishing in nearby areas, while longer trips suggest trolling, longlining, or distant fishing grounds. **Range categories** reflect vessel capabilities and target species preferences.

**Gear type inference** is based on behavioral patterns rather than direct observation. This probabilistic approach provides useful insights while acknowledging uncertainty in gear identification from movement data alone.

```{r trip-gear-analysis}
# Trip duration categories for gear type inference
trip_patterns <- trip_summary %>%
  mutate(
    duration_category = case_when(
      duration_hours < 3 ~ "Short (<3h)",
      duration_hours < 6 ~ "Half Day (3-6h)",
      duration_hours < 12 ~ "Full Day (6-12h)",
      duration_hours < 24 ~ "Extended (12-24h)",
      TRUE ~ "Multi-Day (>24h)"
    ),
    range_category = case_when(
      max_range_km < 2 ~ "Very Near Shore",
      max_range_km < 5 ~ "Near Shore",
      max_range_km < 10 ~ "Moderate Range",
      TRUE ~ "Long Range"
    ),
    # Inferred gear type based on patterns
    likely_gear = case_when(
      duration_hours < 3 & max_range_km < 2 ~ "Traps/Nets (Short)",
      duration_hours < 6 & fishing_time_pct > 60 ~ "Handline",
      duration_hours > 6 & max_range_km > 5 ~ "Trolling/Longline", 
      fishing_time_pct < 30 ~ "Ring Net/Seine",
      TRUE ~ "Mixed Gear"
    )
  )

# Gear usage distribution
gear_summary <- trip_patterns %>%
  count(likely_gear) %>%
  mutate(percentage = n / sum(n) * 100)

  hc_add_series(
    data = gear_summary,

The regional comparison reveals significant heterogeneity in fishing operations across Kenya's coast, with each region exhibiting distinct patterns shaped by local conditions, fleet characteristics, and resource availability. These differences highlight the need for region-specific management strategies within the broader national framework.

## Advanced Behavioral Analysis: Vessel Patterns by Region

This section delves deeper into vessel behavior patterns, examining how fishers use space and time, their operational efficiency, and their interactions with each other. These insights are crucial for understanding the human dimensions of fisheries management and designing effective interventions.

### Return Patterns & Site Fidelity

**Site fidelity** - the tendency of vessels to return to the same fishing areas - reveals important aspects of fishing strategy and traditional knowledge. High site fidelity suggests that fishers have identified productive areas and consistently return to them, indicating either reliable resource availability or traditional fishing grounds passed down through generations.

Understanding return patterns helps managers identify: - **Critical fishing areas** that deserve special protection - **Traditional fishing grounds** that should be considered in spatial planning\
- **Vessel specialization** versus opportunistic fishing strategies - **Regional differences** in fishing culture and resource knowledge

```{r return-patterns-analysis}
# Analyze vessel return patterns - do boats return to same fishing areas?
# Site fidelity analysis by region

library(igraph)

# Calculate site fidelity - vessels returning to same grid cells
site_fidelity <- tracks_processed %>%
  group_by(boat, region, lat_grid, lng_grid) %>%
  summarise(
    visits = n(),
    fishing_visits = sum(activity == "Fishing"),
    first_visit = min(date),
    last_visit = max(date),
    visit_span_days = as.numeric(last_visit - first_visit),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  filter(visits >= 2) %>%  # Only areas visited multiple times
  group_by(boat, region) %>%
  summarise(
    n_revisited_areas = n(),
    total_revisits = sum(visits - 1),
    avg_visits_per_area = mean(visits),
    max_visit_span = max(visit_span_days, na.rm = TRUE),
    fishing_site_loyalty = sum(fishing_visits) / sum(visits),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

# Regional site fidelity patterns  
regional_fidelity <- site_fidelity %>%
  group_by(region) %>%
  summarise(
    vessels_with_fidelity = n(),
    avg_revisited_areas = mean(n_revisited_areas),
    avg_site_loyalty = mean(fishing_site_loyalty),
    avg_visit_span = mean(max_visit_span, na.rm = TRUE),
    high_fidelity_vessels = sum(fishing_site_loyalty > 0.7),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_site_loyalty))

cat("Regional Site Fidelity Analysis:\n")
print(regional_fidelity)

# Visualization of site fidelity by region
highchart() %>%
  hc_add_series(
    data = regional_fidelity,
    type = "column",
    hcaes(x = region, y = round(avg_site_loyalty * 100, 1)),
    name = "Average Site Loyalty (%)",
    color = "#27AE60"
  ) %>%
  hc_add_series(
    data = regional_fidelity,
    type = "line", 
    hcaes(x = region, y = round(avg_revisited_areas, 1)),
    name = "Avg Revisited Areas",
    yAxis = 1,
    color = "#E74C3C"
  ) %>%
  hc_title(text = "Vessel Site Fidelity by Region") %>%
  hc_subtitle(text = "Tendency to return to same fishing areas") %>%
  hc_xAxis(title = list(text = "Region")) %>%
  hc_yAxis_multiples(
    list(title = list(text = "Site Loyalty (%)")),
    list(title = list(text = "Average Revisited Areas"), opposite = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  hc_tooltip(shared = TRUE)
```

The site fidelity chart above shows **two key metrics**: the percentage of time vessels spend fishing in areas they revisit (site loyalty) and the average number of areas each vessel returns to. **High site loyalty** combined with **few revisited areas** suggests specialized fishing strategies, while **low loyalty** with **many areas** indicates exploratory or opportunistic behavior.

**Regional variations** in site fidelity reflect different fishing cultures, resource distributions, and vessel capabilities. Regions with higher fidelity may have more established traditional fishing grounds or more predictable resources.

### Voyage Efficiency Metrics by Region

**Voyage efficiency** represents how effectively vessels convert time and fuel into fishing opportunity. While we cannot directly measure catch or revenue, movement patterns provide valuable proxies for operational efficiency.

**Key efficiency metrics include**: - **Fishing Efficiency**: Proportion of trip time spent actively fishing (higher = better) - **Spatial Efficiency**: Ratio of distance to fishing area versus total distance traveled - **Productivity Proxy**: Combined metric reflecting both time fishing and distance traveled - **Trip Intensity**: Number of different areas explored per hour (may indicate searching behavior)

These metrics help identify **best practices** that could be shared among fishing communities and regions that might benefit from **capacity building** or **infrastructure improvements**.

```{r voyage-efficiency-analysis}

## Methodology

### Data Collection & Processing

#### Study Design and Deployment

This study represents one of the largest vessel tracking initiatives in East African small-scale fisheries. Between \[DATE RANGE\], **150 solar-powered Pelagic Data Systems (PDS) units** were deployed across **28 Beach Management Units** spanning **five coastal counties** in Kenya. This deployment strategy ensures representative coverage of the diverse fishing communities and marine environments along Kenya's coast.

#### Vessel Tracking Technology

The Pelagic Data Systems represent state-of-the-art tracking technology designed specifically for small-scale fishing vessels. Each unit consists of: - **Solar-powered GPS tracker** with 5-minute position recording intervals - **Satellite communication system** for data transmission - **Weather-resistant housing** suitable for marine environments - **Long-term battery backup** for continuous operation

#### Data Structure and Variables

Each GPS position record contains five primary variables: - **Timestamp**: Exact time of position recording (UTC) - **Location**: High-precision latitude and longitude coordinates (decimal degrees) - **Speed**: Instantaneous vessel speed in meters per second (converted to nautical knots: m/s × 1.94384) - **Range**: Distance from coastline calculated using GPS coordinates and coastline data (see methodology below) - **Heading**: Vessel direction in degrees (0-360°, where 0° = North)

#### Critical Innovation: Accurate Distance-to-Coast Calculation

**The Challenge**: The original PDS data included a "Range (Meters)" variable assumed to represent distance from shore, but analysis revealed this represented distance from a fixed reference point, not the coastline.

**Our Solution**: We developed a robust distance-to-coast calculation using: - **Coastline Data**: Natural Earth high-resolution coastline data for the Kenya region - **Projection System**: UTM Zone 37S projection for accurate distance measurement in meters - **Spatial Analysis**: Advanced geospatial processing using the sf package in R - **Quality Control**: Validation against known coastal features and fishing patterns

**Why This Matters**: Accurate coastal distance is fundamental for: - Defining fishing zones and marine spatial planning - Understanding vessel operational ranges and capabilities\
- Analyzing resource accessibility and fishing pressure - Developing zone-based management regulations

#### Data Quality and Coverage

The dataset comprises **46,625 high-resolution position records** representing: - **Temporal Coverage**: \[X months/years\] of continuous monitoring - **Spatial Coverage**: Kenya's entire coastal fishing zone - **Fleet Representation**: Diverse vessel types and fishing strategies - **Regional Balance**: Proportional coverage across all major fishing regions

**Quality Assurance Measures**: - Automated removal of impossible speeds (\>15 knots for small-scale vessels) - Filtering of positions on land or beyond reasonable fishing ranges - Trip boundary detection to separate distinct fishing voyages - Cross-validation with known fishing patterns and seasonal behavior

#### Spatial Grid Analysis

To analyze spatial patterns, continuous GPS coordinates are aggregated into grid cells: - **Grid Resolution**: 500m × 500m (achieved by rounding lat/lng × 200 ÷ 200) - **Purpose**: Enables hotspot identification and density analysis while maintaining privacy - **Grid Cell Metrics**: Number of visits, unique vessels, total time spent

### Key Metrics Explained

#### Vessel Activity Coefficient (VAC)

VAC = Total Trips / Number of Active Weeks

-   **Interpretation**: Average trips per week for each vessel
-   **Categories**:
    -   Low (\<1 trip/week)
    -   Moderate (1-2 trips/week)
    -   High (2-3 trips/week)
    -   Very High (\>3 trips/week)

#### Fishing Activity Classification

Based on vessel speed patterns: - **Stationary/Drifting**: \<0.5 knots (anchored or drifting with current) - **Fishing**: 0.5-2 knots (active fishing operations) - **Slow Transit**: 2-4 knots (moving between fishing spots) - **Fast Transit**: \>4 knots (traveling to/from fishing grounds)

#### Fishing Zones

Distance-based classification from shore: - **Inshore**: \<1 km (reef lagoons, shallow waters) - **Near-shore**: 1-3 km (reef edges, moderate depths) - **Offshore**: 3-5 km (open water, deeper fishing) - **Deep-sea**: 5-12 km (offshore fishing grounds) - **Pelagic**: \>12 km (far offshore, pelagic species)

### Hotspot Analysis

#### Fishing Intensity Score

Intensity Score = Fishing Hours × √(Unique Vessels)

-   **Purpose**: Identifies areas with both high effort AND multiple vessels
-   **Square Root**: Prevents single vessels from dominating the score
-   **Categories**: Based on percentiles (95th = Critical, 85th = Major, 70th = Moderate)

#### Hotspot Classification

-   **Critical Hotspot**: Top 5% intensity scores
-   **Major Hotspot**: 85-95th percentile
-   **Moderate Hotspot**: 70-85th percentile
-   **Regular Activity**: Below 70th percentile

### Resource Conflict Analysis

#### Conflict Event Definition

A conflict event occurs when: - Multiple vessels (≥2) are present in the same grid cell - During the same hour - On the same date

#### Conflict Risk Levels

-   High Risk: Average vessels \>3 OR Maximum vessels \>5
-   Moderate Risk: Average vessels \>2 OR Maximum vessels \>3
-   Low Risk: Average vessels \>1.5
-   Minimal Risk: Average vessels ≤1.5

#### Conflict Metrics

-   **Conflict Events**: Total occurrences of multi-vessel overlap
-   **Average Vessels per Conflict**: Mean number of vessels involved
-   **Total Vessel-Hours**: Sum of vessels × hours for conflict intensity

### Trip Characteristics

#### Trip Duration

-   Calculated as time difference between first and last GPS record of a trip
-   Trips \<30 minutes are excluded as likely false starts or data errors
-   Categories: Short (\<3h), Half Day (3-6h), Full Day (6-12h), Extended (12-24h), Multi-Day (\>24h)

#### Fishing Time Percentage

Fishing Time % = (Number of Fishing Activity Records / Total Trip Records) × 100

-   Indicates proportion of trip spent actively fishing vs. transit

#### Maximum Range

-   Furthest distance from shore reached during the trip
-   Used to infer gear types and fishing strategies

### Gear Type Inference

Based on trip patterns, likely gear types are inferred:

-   **Traps/Nets (Short)**: Duration \<3h AND Coastal Distance \<2km
-   **Handline**: Duration \<6h AND Fishing Time \>60%\
-   **Trolling/Longline**: Duration \>6h AND Coastal Distance \>5km
-   **Ring Net/Seine**: Fishing Time \<30% (more time searching than fishing)
-   **Mixed Gear**: Patterns don't clearly match single gear type

### Seasonal Analysis

#### Monthly Metrics

-   **Fishing Hours**: Total hours spent fishing (5-minute records × 5/60)
-   **Active Vessels**: Count of unique vessel IDs per month
-   **Average Range**: Mean maximum distance from shore

#### Temporal Patterns

-   **Peak Hours**: Distribution of trip start times
-   **Weekly Patterns**: Activity levels by day of week
-   **Seasonal Trends**: Monthly variations in effort and fleet size

### Regional Comparison

#### Regional Metrics

-   **Fleet Size**: Number of unique vessels per region
-   **Effort Distribution**: Percentage of fishing time in each zone
-   **Operational Characteristics**: Average trip duration and range
-   **Conflict Intensity**: Average vessels per conflict event

#### Zone Preferences

Percentage of fishing time spent in each distance zone, revealing regional fishing strategies and resource utilization patterns.

### Data Quality & Limitations

#### GPS Accuracy

-   Position accuracy: ±5-10 meters
-   Temporal resolution: 5-minute intervals
-   Missing data: Gaps may occur due to signal loss or device malfunction

#### Analysis Assumptions

-   Speed thresholds for activity classification based on typical SSF vessel capabilities
-   Grid cell size balances spatial resolution with privacy concerns
-   Conflict analysis assumes co-location indicates resource competition

#### Interpretation Caveats

-   Gear type inference is probabilistic, not definitive
-   Hotspots may reflect both resource abundance and accessibility
-   VAC calculations assume consistent vessel identification across trips
