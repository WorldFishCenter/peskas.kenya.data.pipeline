\usage{
map_surveys(
  data = NULL,
  taxa_mapping = NULL,
  gear_mapping = NULL,
  vessels_mapping = NULL,
  sites_mapping = NULL,
  geo_mapping = NULL,
  kefs_v2 = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame with preprocessed survey data. For standard surveys, must contain
catch_taxon, gear, vessel_type, and landing_site columns. For KEFs v2 surveys, must
contain priority_species, sample_species, gear, vessel_type, and landing_site columns.}

\item{taxa_mapping}{A data frame from Airtable taxa table with survey_label, alpha3_code,
and scientific_name columns.}

\item{gear_mapping}{A data frame from Airtable gears table with survey_label and
standard_name columns.}

\item{vessels_mapping}{A data frame from Airtable vessels table with survey_label and
standard_name columns.}

\item{sites_mapping}{A data frame from Airtable landing_sites table with site_code and
site columns.}

\item{geo_mapping}{A data frame from Airtable geo table with GAUL codes and names}

\item{kefs_v2}{Logical. If TRUE, processes data from the KEFs v2 survey form which
uses priority_species and sample_species columns. If FALSE (default), processes
standard survey forms with catch_taxon column.}
}
\value{
A tibble with survey labels replaced by standardized names:
\itemize{
\item For standard surveys: catch_taxon replaced by scientific_name and alpha3_code
\item For KEFs v2 surveys: priority_species replaced by priority_scientific_name and
priority_alpha3_code; sample_species replaced by sample_scientific_name and
sample_alpha3_code
\item gear and vessel_type replaced by standardized names
\item landing_site replaced by the full site name
}
Records without matches will have NA values.
}
\description{
Converts local species, gear, and vessel labels from surveys to standardized names using
Airtable reference tables. Handles two survey form types: the standard form which uses
catch_taxon, and the KEFs v2 form which uses priority_species and sample_species.
Replaces local names with scientific names and alpha3 codes, and standardizes gear,
vessel, and site names.
}
\details{
This function is called within \code{preprocess_landings()} after processing raw survey data.
The mapping tables are retrieved from Airtable frame base and filtered by
form ID before being passed to this function.

The KEFs v2 survey form captures both priority species (target catch) and sample species
(for biological sampling), requiring separate taxonomic mappings for each.
