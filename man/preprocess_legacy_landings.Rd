\title{Preprocess Legacy Landings Data}
\usage{
preprocess_legacy_landings()
}
\value{
This function does not return a value. Instead, it processes the data and uploads
the result to a MongoDB collection in the pipeline database.
}
\description{
This function imports, preprocesses, and cleans legacy landings data from a MongoDB collection.
It performs various data cleaning and transformation operations, including column renaming,
removal of unnecessary columns, generation of unique identifiers, and data type conversions.
The processed data is then uploaded back to MongoDB.
}
\details{
The function performs the following main operations:
\enumerate{
\item Pulls raw data from the raw data MongoDB collection.
\item Removes several unnecessary columns.
\item Renames columns for clarity (e.g., 'site' to 'landing_site').
\item Generates unique 'survey_id' and 'catch_id' fields.
\item Converts several string fields to lowercase.
\item Cleans catch names using a separate function 'clean_catch_names'.
\item Uploads the processed data to the preprocessed MongoDB collection.
}
}
\note{
This function requires a configuration file to be present and readable by the
'read_config' function, which should provide MongoDB connection details.
