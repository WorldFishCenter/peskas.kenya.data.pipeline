\usage{
get_indicators_flags(dat = NULL, limits = NULL, clean_ids = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{A data frame containing KEFS survey data with columns:
\itemize{
\item submission_id: Unique identifier for the submission
\item no_of_fishers: Number of fishers on the trip
\item trip_duration: Duration of the trip in hours
\item total_catch_weight: Total weight of catch in kilograms
\item total_catch_price: Total price of catch in Kenyan Shillings
}}

\item{limits}{A list containing threshold values for validation:
\itemize{
\item max_cpue: Maximum acceptable catch per unit effort (kg/fisher/hour)
\item max_rpue: Maximum acceptable revenue per unit effort (KSH/fisher/hour)
\item max_price_kg: Maximum acceptable price per kilogram (KSH/kg)
}}

\item{clean_ids}{A vector of submission IDs that have passed previous validation checks.
Only these submissions will be evaluated for indicator-based anomalies.}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns:
\itemize{
\item submission_id: The original submission identifier
\item alert_flag_indicators: Comma-separated string of alert codes (NA if no alerts):
\itemize{
\item "6.1": CPUE (catch per unit effort) exceeds maximum
\item "6.2": RPUE (revenue per unit effort) exceeds maximum
\item "6.3": Price per kilogram exceeds maximum
}
}
}
\description{
This function validates derived fisheries indicators (CPUE, RPUE, and price per kg)
from KEFS survey data. It calculates these performance metrics and flags values that
exceed specified maximum thresholds. This validation is applied only to submissions
that have passed previous validation checks.
}
\details{
The function calculates three key fisheries performance indicators:
\enumerate{
\item CPUE (Catch Per Unit Effort): total_catch_weight / no_of_fishers / trip_duration
\item RPUE (Revenue Per Unit Effort): total_catch_price / no_of_fishers / trip_duration
\item Price per kg: total_catch_price / total_catch_weight
}

These indicators help identify submissions with unrealistically high productivity or
pricing that may indicate data entry errors or exceptional circumstances requiring review.

This function is typically called after trip-level and catch-level validations have been
performed, applying additional scrutiny only to submissions that have already been
determined to be generally valid.
