\title{Calculate Individual Fisher Performance Metrics}
\usage{
get_individual_metrics(validated_data = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{validated_data}{A data frame containing validated fishery data with columns:
\itemize{
\item landing_site: Name of the landing site (will be renamed to BMU)
\item landing_date: Date of landing
\item fisher_id: Unique identifier for each fisher
\item no_of_fishers: Number of fishers
\item total_catch_kg: Total catch in kilograms
\item total_catch_price: Total catch value in currency
\item trip_cost: Cost of fishing trip in currency
}}
}
\value{
A data frame with monthly aggregated metrics by BMU and individual fisher:
\itemize{
\item BMU: Name of the Beach Management Unit (title case)
\item date: First day of the month
\item fisher_id: Unique identifier for each fisher
\item mean_cpue: Average catch (kg) per fisher
\item mean_rpue: Average revenue per fisher
\item mean_price_kg: Average price per kg
\item mean_costs: Average trip costs per fisher
\item mean_profit: Average profit per fisher (revenue minus costs)
}
}
\description{
Calculates key fishery performance metrics at the individual fisher level from
validated catch data, including CPUE (Catch Per Unit Effort), RPUE (Revenue Per
Unit Effort), price per kg, trip costs, and profit margins for each fisher.
}
\details{
Individual fisher metrics are calculated as follows:
\itemize{
\item CPUE = Aggregated catch (kg) / Total fishers
\item RPUE = Aggregated revenue / Total fishers
\item Price per kg = Total revenue / Total catch (median across trips)
\item Costs = Median trip cost
\item Profit = RPUE - Costs
}

The function filters for records with non-missing landing dates and fisher IDs,
then aggregates data by landing date, BMU, and fisher ID before calculating
monthly averages. Only fishers with individual identification are included
in the analysis.
