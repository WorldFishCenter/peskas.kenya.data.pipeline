\title{Synchronize Validation Statuses with KoboToolbox}
\usage{
sync_validation_submissions(log_threshold = logger::DEBUG)
}
\arguments{
\item{log_threshold}{The logging level threshold for the logger package (e.g., DEBUG, INFO).
Default is logger::DEBUG.}
}
\value{
None. The function performs status updates and database operations as side effects.
}
\description{
Synchronizes validation statuses between the local system and KoboToolbox by processing
validation flags and updating submission statuses accordingly. This function respects
manual human approvals and handles both flagged and clean submissions in parallel with rate limiting.
}
\details{
The function follows these steps:
\enumerate{
\item Downloads the current validation flags from cloud storage
\item Sets up parallel processing using the future package (max 4 workers with rate limiting)
\item Fetches current validation status from KoboToolbox to identify manual approvals
\item Identifies manually approved submissions and preserves them (excludes system approvals)
\item Processes flagged submissions (marking as not approved), EXCLUDING manually approved ones
\item Processes clean submissions (marking as approved)
\item Combines validation statuses from updates and preserved manual approvals
\item Adds KoboToolbox validation status to validation flags
\item Pushes all validation flags with KoboToolbox status to MongoDB for record-keeping
}

Progress reporting is enabled to track the status of submissions being processed.
}
\note{
This function requires proper configuration in the config file, including:
\itemize{
\item MongoDB connection parameters
\item KoboToolbox asset ID and token (configured under ingestion$kefs$koboform)
\item Google cloud storage parameters
}
}
\section{Manual Approval Preservation}{

The function identifies submissions that have been manually approved by humans (validated_by
is not empty and is not the system username) and preserves these approvals even if automated
validation would flag them. Flagged submissions that were manually approved will NOT be
marked as "not approved" by this function. This ensures human review decisions are always
respected and never overwritten by the automated system.
}

\section{Rate Limiting}{

To avoid overwhelming the KoboToolbox API server (kf.fimskenya.co.ke), the function limits
parallel workers to 4 and adds a 200ms delay between requests. This provides approximately
20 requests per second across all workers while maintaining server stability. With this
configuration, processing 13,000 submissions takes approximately 2-3 hours (including the
initial status fetch to identify manual approvals).
